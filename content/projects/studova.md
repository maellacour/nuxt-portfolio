    Challenge

    #details
    Building a comprehensive SaaS platform for research studies required solving complex technical challenges while maintaining usability for non-technical researchers.

    **Key Features Implemented:**
    - **Visual Flow Designer**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating study workflows with branching logic and randomization
    - **Flexible Data Collection**: Dynamic schema validation supporting diverse task types (surveys, cognitive tests, behavioral assessments)
    - **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Team-based isolation with role-based permissions
    - **Participant Tracking**: Real-time progression monitoring with visual status indicators
    - **Advanced Analytics**: JSON-indexed queries for efficient result aggregation

    **Core Technical Solutions:**

    **1. Graph-Based Flow Architecture**  
    Implemented a directed graph structure using FlowElements and FlowLinks to enable researchers to create complex study workflows. Developed a graph traversal algorithm to determine execution order and validate flow integrity, ensuring participants always have a valid path from START to END.

    **2. Dynamic Schema Validation**  
    Designed a hybrid approach combining ResultVariable models (defining data structure with metadata) and JSON storage with PostgreSQL GIN indexing. This achieved schema flexibility without migration overhead while maintaining type safety and query performance through runtime Zod schema generation.

    **3. Results Visualization**  
    Created an intuitive color-coded system for displaying participant progressâ€”colored cells for completed tasks, grey + hatched pattern for pending ones. Ordered task columns by flow sequence and designed visual legends with accessibility considerations (pattern + color).
