  title: About me
  description: >
    <p>During my general engineering training, I discovered my passion for project development, especially in the realm of computer science.
    This realization naturally led me to focus on 2D and 3D technologies, fields that offer a vast array of exciting possibilities.
    My love for learning has driven me to continuously expand my skill set, diving deep into various tools and languages.<br />
    After my start with with web development, I ventured into the fascinating world of 3D graphics, mastering Unity and Blender.
    My curiosity didn't stop there – I then delved into C#, the HLSL shader language and its Shader Nodes counterpart among other tools and technologies.
    The list of things I've explored is extensive, but I always thrive on the challenge of mastering each new one !</p>
    <br />
    <p>In my professional roles, I have always prioritized quality and resilience.
    I believe that applications should not only be functional but also robust and adaptable.
    My aim is to deliver solutions that empower my partners, giving them the tools they need to achieve true autonomy and success in their endeavors.</p>
